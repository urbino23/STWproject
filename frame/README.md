# AvianVisitors e-ink frame

*The last 24h of birds, framed on the wall by your window.*

A [Pimoroni Inky Impression 13.3"](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression-13-3) (Spectra 6) mirroring the live collage. A Pi screenshots the site, mats it onto an A5 opening, and pushes to the panel, refreshing only when the birds change. Build one of your own at [theodore.net/projects/AvianVisitors#frame-ous](https://theodore.net/projects/AvianVisitors/#frame-ous).

## 1. Flash the SD card

Flash an sd card with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) via [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). In the customisation dialog set:

- Username
- WiFi SSID + password
- Hostname: `birdpic`
- Enable SSH with password auth

Then install in Pi and power up.

## 2. Run the installer

```bash
ssh <your-username>@birdpic.local
git clone https://github.com/Twarner491/AvianVisitors
cd AvianVisitors/frame && ./install.sh
```

Enables SPI + I2C, installs the deps and a 15-minute systemd timer, writes `~/.birdframe/config.toml`, and reboots once to bring SPI up.

## 3. Point it at the collage

After it reboots and comes back, set your image source in `~/.birdframe/config.toml`. The Pi is too small to run a browser, so it fetches a ready-made PNG that the aggregator Worker renders at `/frame.png`, gated by a key:

```toml
base_url  = "https://bird.onethreenine.net"
image_url = "https://bird.onethreenine.net/frame.png?k=YOUR_FRAME_KEY"
```

No Worker? Set `shoot = true` to screenshot on any capable host instead. Full options are in [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml).
